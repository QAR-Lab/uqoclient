        Required parameters:
            1) num_generations: The number of generations/iterations of the genetic algorithm.
            2) sol_per_pop: The number of solutions/chromosomes/individuals in the population (i.e. population size).
            3) num_parents_mating: The number of solutions to be selected from the population as parents for mating and
            producing the offspring.
        Optional parameters:
            4) initial_population: A user-defined initial population as a list of chromosomes. If you use this parameter,
            the parameter sol_per_pop has no action.
            Example: "initial_population": [[0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]
            5) parent_selection_type: The parent selection type. Supported types are:
               sss (for steady-state selection),
               rws (for roulette wheel selection),
               sus (for stochastic universal selection),
               rank (for rank selection),
               random (for random selection),
               tournament (for tournament selection)
            6) keep_parents: Number of parents to keep in the current population. -1 (default) means to keep all parents in
            the next population. 0 means keep no parents in the next population. A value greater than 0 means keeps the
            specified number of parents in the next population. Note that the assigned value to the keep_parent parameter
            must satisfy the following conditions:
                a) Less than or equal to sol_per_pop
                b) Less than or equal to num_parents_mating
                c) Greater than or equal to -1.
            7) K_tournament: In case that the parent selection type is tournament, the K_tournament specifies the number of
            parents participating in the tournament selection. (default 3).
            8) crossover_type: Type of the crossover operation. Supported types are:
               single_point (for single-point crossover),
               two_points (for two points crossover),
               uniform (for uniform crossover),
               scattered (for scattered crossover)
               It defaults to single_point.
            9) crossover_probability: The probability of selecting a parent for applying the crossover operation.
            Its value must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. For each parent, a random value between 0.0 and 1.0 is
            generated. If this random value is less than or equal to the value assigned to the crossover_probability
            parameter, then the parent is selected.
            10) mutation_type: Type of the mutation operation. Supported types are:
                random (for random mutation),
                swap (for swap mutation),
                inversion (for inversion mutation),
                scramble (for scramble mutation),
                adaptive (for adaptive mutation),
                reverse_annealing.
                It defaults to random.
                If you use reverse_annealing, you must also define 'reinitialize_state', 's_target' and 'hold_time' (see
                reverse annealing examples)
            11) mutation_probability: The probability of selecting a gene for applying the mutation operation.
            Its value must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. For each gene in a solution, a random value between 0.0 and 1.0
            is generated. If this random value is less than or equal to the value assigned to the mutation_probability
            parameter, then the gene is selected. If this parameter exists, then there is no need for the 2 parameters
            mutation_percent_genes and mutation_num_genes.
            12) mutation_by_replacement: An optional bool parameter. It works only when the selected type of mutation is
            random (mutation_type="random"). In this case, mutation_by_replacement=True means replace the gene by the
            randomly generated value. If False, then it has no effect and random mutation works by adding the random value
            to the gene.
            13) mutation_percent_genes: Percentage of genes to mutate. It defaults to the string "default" which is later
            translated into the integer 10 which means 10% of the genes will be mutated. It must be >0 and <=100. Out of
            this percentage, the number of genes to mutate is deduced which is assigned to the mutation_num_genes parameter.
            The mutation_percent_genes parameter has no action if mutation_probability or mutation_num_genes exist.
            14) mutation_num_genes: Number of genes to mutate which defaults to None meaning that no number is specified.
            The mutation_num_genes parameter has no action if the parameter mutation_probability exists. This parameter has
            no action if mutation_type is None.
            15) stop_criteria=None: Some criteria to stop the evolution. Each criterion is passed as str which has a stop
            word. The current 2 supported words are reach and saturate. reach stops the run() method if the fitness value is
            equal to or greater than a given fitness value. An example for reach is "reach_40" which stops the evolution if
            the fitness is >= 40. saturate means stop the evolution if the fitness saturates for a given number of
            consecutive generations. An example for saturate is "saturate_7" which means stop the run() method if the
            fitness does not change for 7 consecutive generations.
            16) selection_criterion_for_mutation: if you have set mutation_type to reverse_annealing, with the parameter
            selection_criterion_for_mutation you can choose how the offspring chromosomes will be selected for the
            mutation. Possible values:
            fixed_rate (there is a fixed probability that decides if a chromosome will be mutated or not. You can set
            this probability with the parameter reverse_annealing_mutation_rate)
            adaptive (the probability)
            Default is a fixed rate with probability 1.0.
            17) reverse_annealing_fixed_rate: if you have set mutation_type to reverse_annealing and
            selection_criterion_for_mutation to fixed_rate, you can choose a probability rate for mutating a chromosome.
            If you don't set this parameter, the default value is 1.0, meaning that every offspring chromosome will be
            mutated. Possible values are floats in range [0.0, 1.0].
            18) reverse_annealing_adaptive_rate: if you have set mutation_type to reverse_annealing and
            selection_criterion_for_mutation to adaptive, you can choose two probabilities in a list. The first entry
            specifies the probability low-quality solutions will be mutated, the second entry specifies the probability
            high-quality solutions will be mutated. Example: "reverse_annealing_adaptive_rates"=[0.25, 0.1] means with a
            probability of 0.25 low-quality solutions will be mutated and with a probability of 0.1 high-quality
            solutions will be mutated. The quality of a solution is calculated by taking the average fitness value of
            the population. A solution is low-quality if its fitness value is lower than the average, otherwise it is
            high-quality. Default value: [0.75, 0.25]
