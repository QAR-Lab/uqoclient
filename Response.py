    Attributes
    ----------
    sampleset
        Table with solution vectors, energy and number of occurrences
    solutions
        List of the sampled solution vectors
    energies
        List of the solution vectors energies
    num_occurrences
        List of number of occurrences of a solution vector

    Methods
    -------
    print_solutions(), print_energies(), print_num_occurrences()
        Print the solution vectors, the energies and the number of occurrences of the vectors.
    print_solutions_nice()
        Show the solution (solution vectors, energies and number of occurrences) in a well readable table format.
